# Zomato-Clone
This repository contains the code for a basic Zomato website clone made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for restaurants, browse menus, and view restaurant ratings and reviews. This project is a great way to learn the fundamentals of web development and to experiment with building more complex websites.
